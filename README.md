**DevTools Platform** is your all-in-one launchpad, fusing power-packed utilities (JSON Viewer, Hash Generator, UUID Generator) with productivity dynamos (Todo Manager, Pomodoro Timer) and an AI Assistant that thinks ahead. Powered by Supabase for bulletproof auth and data sync, it delivers a customizable dashboard, real-time insights, and a UI that scales to handle FAANG-level traffic. Say goodbye to tool-switching—hello to building at warp speed!
